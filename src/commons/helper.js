 /* FIXME:
  This isn't the best way to do this, but plugins currently have a lot
  of repetitive goop in their titles.
  plugins leading with 'Jenkins' is particularly bad because then sorting
  on the name lumps a bunch of plugins toggether incorrectly.
  but even 'plugin' at the end of the string is just junk.
  All of these are plugins.
